<h2> Project O.S.C.A.R. - Open Source Cancer Annihilation Research</h2>

<br>
<h4> Our Purpose </h4>
<hr>
<p>
The point of this repository is to initiate a change in cancer research. The medical industry is failing us.  In a day and age when we have access to more data than ever before, with greater and greater technology and its interconnectiveness, I find it hard to believe that we can not cure cancer if we put everything in to it and work together.  Unfortunately, the way the medical industry is ran, most research remains private and while one breakthrough from one person will help another, they may never see key data points that they need to make the next breakthrough. 
</p>

<br>
<h4> Our Mission </h4>
<hr>
<p>
Our mission objective is simple.  We seek to completely annihilate cancer in all of it forms.  We seek not just to treat the symptoms, but to cure individuals of it and to experience a complete remission. We will achieve this no later than 2030, if not sooner. 
</p>

<br>
<h4> How We'll Achieve This </h4>
<hr>
<p>
We'll achieve this by partnering together to share ideas and information.  We will work together to do the research, to develop data points and other useful information insights, we will raise awareness of the project and seek help from all industries to partner with us.

<h4> What You Can Do To Help </h4>
<hr>
<p>
Here are some ways that individuals can help with our project.  These may change as the project grows and more of us begin to collaborate together.
<ul>
<li>Develop ML/DL models to run analysis on datasets to identify cancer via DNA to help with early diagnosis</li>
<li>Create or provide different datasets that are open to the public for cancer research studies</li>
<li>Provide links to different studies, articles, and medical journals that go into oncology and talk about the latest breakthroughs</li>
<li>Research and share your ideas, no matter how outrageous, on what you think a good path would be to help in our endevour to completely eliminate cancer</li>
<li>Recruiter others to our cause that can help in different industries (Development, Data Science, Legal, etc) and raise awareness to the project</li>
<li>Introduce us to different company executives who may partner with us to allow us to leverage their cutting edge Med Tech or AI Tech</li>
</ul>
